# Get-branch-rank

This script calculates the branch rank of an IIT Kharagpur student given his/her roll number.

## Note: I've treated 5 year and 4 year courses as different branches.

## Prerequisites

Get-branch-rank requires **Python's** libraries *requests* and *BeautifulSoup*.

To install the requirements just run the following command in your terminal\n

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

# How to use it:
1. Just open your terminal and run the script:\n
``>> python get_branch_rank.py
``
and press ENTER
2. Enter your roll number and wait for some time. You will get your rank in your branch.

So enjoy!!
