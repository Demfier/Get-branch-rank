# Get-branch-rank

This script calculates the branch rank of an IIT Kharagpur student given his/her roll number

## Note: I've treated 5 year and 4 year courses as different branches.

# How to use it:
1. Just open your terminal and run the script:
``python
    python get_branch_rank.py
``
and press ENTER
2. Enter your roll number and wait for some time. You will get your rank in your branch.

I have taken care of the cases where a user enters an invalid roll number or if accidently adds spaces in the roll number.

So enjoy!!
